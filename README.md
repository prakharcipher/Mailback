# Mail-Back

This is a full stack SaaS web application built on ReactJS, Redux and NodeJS. It allows a client to login via Google, create surveys and collect feedback from his service's users in bulk. The Dashboard is well laid out to display the real time responses of users on each survey. A payment system is implemented in the application that allows the client to add some credits to send out one survey.
